[b]Optional Pack B: Skill Stacking (Cannot benefit from any other Pack)[/b]

By losing a Skill Point, you are able to stack skills to players in your roster, limiting the use according to the

1 Skill Stack for Tier 1-2, 2 Skill Stacks for Tier 3-4, 3 Skill Stacks for Tier 5-6.

5-6 teams .
Star Players in couples count as two Star Players for the roster.
For every Star Player acquired additional Skill Points cost as follows:
000-099k then 1 Skill Point
100-199k then 2 Skill Points
200-299k then 3 Skill Points
Banned Star Players: Griff Oberwald, Hakflem Skuttlespike, Morg 'n' Thorg, Bomber Dribblesnot, Cindy
Piewhistle, Deeproot Strongbranch, Kreek Rustgouger, Estelle La Veneaux.
The same Star Player cannot play in a game where both coaches have rostered him/her.

[b]Optional Pack D: Extra Skill Point (Cannot benefit from any other Pack)[/b]
The roster is created as the Basic Pack PLUS the below benefit.
One extra Skill Point is gained, as long as the usage of the Skill Points from the coach do not exceed in
total 3 times that skill in the roster. This extra skill should not exceed in total 3 times that skill in the roster
too.
Example: A dark elf team with 4 blitzers, 2 witches and 5 LineElves can have this extra skill as long as the
Skill Points from the tier and the extra Skill Point from the blessing do not add the Block skill because there
are already more than 3 but not from the skill point usage, and can add maximum 1 more Dodge skill
because there are already 2 in the roster and by spending 1 Skill Point the total number reaches 3.

A minimum of 11 players and a maximum of 16 are to be rostered.
• 0-8 Re-Rolls
• 0-6 Assistant coaches
• 0-12 Cheerleaders
• 0-1 Apothecary, if allowed on the team
• 0-6 Dedicated Fans


0-1 Team Mascot for 30k available to all teams - will be available in the tabletop event but not for this event

The following inducements are available:
• 0-1 Weather Mage for 30k available to all teams
• 1 Master Chef for 300k, for 100k available to teams with the "Halfling Thimble Cup" special rule
• 0-6 Assistant coaches (10k)
• 0-12 Cheerleaders (10k)
• 0-2 Bloodweiser Kegs (50k)
• 0-1 Josef Bugman for 100k available to all teams
• 0-1 Plague Doctor for 100k available to teams with the "Favored of Nurgle" special rule
• 0-1 Riotous Rookies for 100k available to teams with the "Low Cost Linemen" special rule

• 0-3 Bribes for 100k each, for "Bribery and Corruption" teams 50k each
• No Biased ref may be taken

A roster cannot induce bribes as long as there is a player with the Sneaky Git skill AND/OR the Secret
Weapon skill. Goblin and Snotling teams have managed to find a "legal" way to avoid this rule, so they can
induce bribes while their roster contains players with the Secret Weapon skill BUT NOT the Sneaky Git
skill.
No roster may have the sneaky git and dirty player skill on the same player, they can be on different players
